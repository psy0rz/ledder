# Rein's Collection
These examples are just proof-of-concepts to show how easy it is to create a ledder animation. 
Some animations are really nice, but some suck and will steal your computers processortime and memory to create ten-thousands of obsolete pixels.
You can use this code for your own animations under the condition that you (try to) make things more pretty than i did ;-)

## Starter
* Rainbowsinus - Sinus, cosinus and a rainbow color palette
* Kong - Ascii animation of Kong
* Fireworks - Fireworks
* XmasSantaReindeer - ascii arts sprite animation of Santa, a sled and a reindeer.
* Julibrot - Mandelbrot and Julia fractal sets with animated zoom and user configurable zoom, speed and colorpalette
* Love - Composite and more complex animation created for a friends wedding with ascii-art sprites


## 3D
* Cube  - 3D cube with rotation calculation bugs....but it looks nice
* Cubevec3 - slightly improved version of cube..has still som enice looking error
* Cube2 - An animated 3d cube without errors...there are more 3d shapes in the code you can use
* DNA   - DNA ladder with 3d fading effect
* Grasmaaier - Landscape version of DNA

## Clocks
* Clock  - A combined digital and analogue clock
* ClockAnalogue - An analogue clock, best viewed on 32x32 displays or larger
* Sensorclock32x8 - A digital clock and MQTT sensor value display for temperature, humidity and pressure. Optimized for 32x8 displays but works on others

## Fractals 
* Julibrot - Mandelbrot and Julia fractal sets with animated zoom and user configurable zoom, speed and colorpalette

## Game Demo's (fake games)
* Poleposition - Inspired by the 80's arcade racing game
* Pong - Inspired by the The 80's arcade game
* Jetfighter - Another fakegame
* Landscapescroller - Fun with ascii-art
* Planets - Animation of our sun and its planets
* Planetsgone - Pacman eats the planets, ghost eats pacman

## MULTIPLAYER GAMES  (real games)
* Pong - MQTT multiplayer game
* Tankwars - MQTT multiplayer game

## MQTT
* MQTTClimate - MQTT Sensor visualization
* Sensorclock32x8 - A digital clock and MQTT sensor value display for temperature, humidity and pressure with custom hardcoded font
* Pong - MQTT multiplayer game
* Tankwars - MQTT multiplayer game

## REMOTE IMAGES & VIDEO
* RemotePlaylist - loads a remote json file with  animation preset sequences
- RemoteImages - loads remote images (also the animated ones)
- RemoteVideo - loads a remote video. Requires FFmpeg

## Simulations (for very fast computers with tons of cpu & memory )
* Beleep - A life simulation - requires a very fast computer with tons of memory because i used to many pixels
* Beleep2 - A life simulation - improved, but  still requires a very fast computer with tons of memory because i used to many pixels
* Weiland - A simulation of cloudlayers and some grass. 

## TEXT DISPLAY
* Headlines - Display a RSS feed with background effects
* Photon - Marquee with multiple colorfull background animations and effects
